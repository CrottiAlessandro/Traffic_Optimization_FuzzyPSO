# Traffic_Optimization_FuzzyPSO
In this project done during my Engineering Physics degree, I've tried to implement a traffic simulation where I've studied the ripple effect of traffic congestion. This occurs when a vehicle brakes sharply or slows significantly in a congested roadway, causing a chain reaction of sudden slowdowns or stops behind it.
